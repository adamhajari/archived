News Parser is a summary of top news stories from NPR.org listed in reverse chronological order.  The story summaries (title, date, link, and description) are collected from an rss feed with the python feedparser module and stored in a MySQL table with python's MySQLdb module.  Clicking on the story title takes you to the full story text with any images from the story shown at the bottom of the page and all ads and other data not related to the story removed.  The full text for each story is ripped from the NPR page for that story using a custom written python script with help from the BeautifulSoup module.  The MySQL table automatically updates whenever the index page is loaded.
