myCalendar:

myCalendar is an online calendar database. Dates and events are displayed in a 
familiar calendar table. Clicking on a day allows users to view the details of 
the events on that day, or add new events. Toggling between months can be done 
with the buttons at the top of the page. The site is written in PHP and javaScript 
and users and events are manged with MySQL.
