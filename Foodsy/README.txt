Foodsy:

Foodsy is a database designed to keep track of the food in your fridge 
(or cabinets, or wherever...). Users have an inventory which lists all
 of their food items and how much of each they have. Clicking on the food 
item allows users to subtract from or add to the amount. Foodsy handles all 
unit conversions for you. Users can also store recipes on the site. clicking on the 
"What can I make" button produces a list of recipes that can be made given the items 
currently in the user's inventory. The site is written in PHP and javaScript and users, 
inventory, and recipes are manged with MySQL.

Note: An important file is missing from this project.  foodsy_connect.php
contains all the relevant information for connecting to thy foodsy mysql
database.  You'll have to create your own database if implenting this yourself.
